            In Video Game Programming, students use coding to create their own video games; they get to make and play their own games! This course specifically introduces various coding software to students so that they can understand those tools at an in-depth level. Video Game Programming is the course taken before taking Intro to Computer Programming, and it prepares students for what is to come in the advanced course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Matthew Hesby, the Video Game Programming Expeditions instructor, teaches students how to use special elements and codes to operate and run a video game. Students in this course learn how to code and create video games of their own; they can then play the games they made in class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Hesby said, “[In] the Video Game Programming Expedition, we start off with a program called Scratch [where] students make programs using that, and then we switch over to a program called Fazer; afterward they use Javascript, and then students are able to choose from there which one they want to use going on. It’s a lot of work time; students are sitting down, making stuff, building.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He continued: “Students don’t just program; they also have to draw out their sprites like: coming up with dialogue, coming up with stories and brainstorming what their games are going to be about.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Rainier freshman Mark Solomita said, “[Video Game Programming] is interesting because it’s fun to see other people’s creations, and you find out what you could do with the knowledge you have with making video games; you don’t know your capacity when it comes to programming, but then you find out what you can do and it’s really satisfying to see your final product.”
