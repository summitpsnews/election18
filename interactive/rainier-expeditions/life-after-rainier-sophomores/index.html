    Life After Rainier instructor Lissa Thiele explained that this course focuses on students realizing their purpose. She shared that the course is designed to “help students realize their maximum potential and who they can be” and that it “helps them define for themselves who they are and what their definition of success is. That is why we must have classes like this.”
