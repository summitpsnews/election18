            The journalism courses at Rainier serve to inform the Summit community of important events and stories through the production and distribution of content. Student journalists work to produce questions and film interviews with Rainier students in order to have valuable content to create informational videos that students can refer to on summitpsnews.org.
        </p>

            There are two levels of this course: Multimedia Political Journalism and Advanced Multimedia Political Journalism (MPJ and AMPJ for short). Both courses do everything previously stated; however, advanced students have the opportunity to go off campus and further expand their skills and experience.

            Keith Dinh, the Rainier Co-Editor-in-Chief, said, “We’ve accomplished a lot of things this year … and I feel like as a whole it’s really touched the heart of many people and this community.”
