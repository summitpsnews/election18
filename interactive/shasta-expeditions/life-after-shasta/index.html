    Life After Shasta is an Expeditions course at Summit Shasta in which students deepen their understanding of themselves by examining their own strengths and weaknesses and how those qualities can be applied to what they want to do after high school. There are two classes, one for sophomores and one for seniors.

    A lot of the work revolves around honing in on potential careers. Pupils have a chance to meet and even shadow professionals working in fields that they find interesting. Students get to focus on more individual needs and opportunities, as opposed to a class like Adulting where topics are more broad.

    “Ideally, every student leaves with a better understanding of who they are right now, where they want to go, and … the steps they need to take in order to get to where they’re going,” Life After Shasta instructor Jackie O’Connor said.

    Shasta sophomore Ethan Pang said this course allows students to find interests that they maybe didn’t even know they had: “If you don’t know what you want to do after high school, or if you would like more guidance figuring out how to get to where you want to be, then this is a really good course for you.”
