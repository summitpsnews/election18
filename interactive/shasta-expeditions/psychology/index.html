    When asked about what she’s learned, Shasta senior Alexandra Velasco said, “I’ve learned a lot in this class, especially about the brain and about why people act in the way they do; and it’s very engaging; and it’s very interesting. Every day you learn something new.”

    When the course teacher, Mrs. Rikhter, was asked why people would want to take this class, she responded by saying, “I think there’s a few reasons. No. 1, it’s a very challenging class; if you are a student that’s interested in doing college-level work, then this is the class for you.”
