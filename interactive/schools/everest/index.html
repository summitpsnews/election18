    As college acceptance is getting more competitive, Summit Public Schoolsâ€™ system of learning stands out for its impressive college acceptance rate. At Everest Public High School, located in Redwood City, 100 percent of graduates of the Class of 2018 were accepted into four-year universities. The Dean of Expeditions, students and the College Readiness teacher all discussed how Everest prepares students for college.

    A unique aspect to Everest, and to Summit Public Schools as a whole, is Expeditions. Expeditions courses occur in two-week sessions, four times a year. By allowing students to experience unconventional and experience-based classes, Expeditions prepares students for college and beyond.

    Another distinct feature of Everest is the Expeditions class College Readiness. College Readiness is required for all juniors and allows students to plan ahead for both paying for and selecting their future college. Expeditions and College Readiness give Summit students an advantage in applying to, preparing for and succeeding in college.
