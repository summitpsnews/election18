    Summit Preparatory Charter High School, founded in 2003, prides itself on its reputation as one of the best public schools in the nation. This tuition-free school in Redwood City, California focuses on preparing its students for success through developing emotional, social and intellectual skills through their shared six core characteristics: courage, compassion, curiosity, integrity, respect and responsibility.

    Graduates from Summit Prep complete four-year college degrees at twice the national average: last year in 2018, 100 percent of the graduating class received acceptances to at least one four-year college or university.

    As it is with every high school, students and staff are more than statistics and words on a website promoting the school. Seniors and the seniorsâ€™ mentors were interviewed to get perspective on how Summit Prep effectively prepares students for college.
