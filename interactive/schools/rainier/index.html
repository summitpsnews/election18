    Summit Rainier opened its doors in 2011 to students of all backgrounds in the East Side San Jose area. Since then, they have maintained a 100 percent college acceptance rate for the past three years due in part to the personalized learning atmosphere Summit has created for its students.

    Among the grades 9 through 12 enrolled at Rainier, community remains at the core of the schoolâ€™s main focus. Through the small school environment, mentor groups and one-on-one class work, students feel strongly supported by their peers and administration to achieve their individual educational goals.

    To learn more about the impact Summit Rainier has had on the current seniors, the graduating Class of 2019, a campus visit was arranged to interview its students and their mentors about their opinion on how well Summit academically prepares students for college.
