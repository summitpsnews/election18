    Summit Public School: Tahoma was established in South San Jose in 2011 by parents wanting a better education for their students and a better path to college. Summit Tahomaâ€™s main focus is making sure 100 percent of the students graduate and are accepted into a four-year college.

    Summit Tahoma, along with the other Summit schools, has mentor groups. Mentor groups are made up of students in the same grade, and they stay together until they graduate. Each mentor group has a mentor. Their mentor helps guide their mentees through school academics, college applications and everything in between. These mentor groups help create friendships and create a stronger feeling of community throughout the school.
