    Whenever a player boots up their favorite game, they might wonder how the game was designed. Video games are made by either a stand-alone person or a group of developers working for a company, and the Video Game Programming Expeditions course helps prepare students for such jobs. The course exists to show students how to develop video games using two programs, Scratch and Phaser.
