    Summit Tahoma has always had core values of self-directed learning and preparing students for college. For school year 2019-20, there will be a new course introduced into the Tahoma Expeditions courses that is designed for juniors who are interested in studying for an AP test that Tahoma doesnâ€™t offer.
</p>
<p>
    This course will be beneficial to juniors, as they cannot enroll in full-day independent study or internships because they must enroll in the half-day College Readiness course. The new class, entitled Self-Guided Study, allows juniors to study something that they are passionate about; they can then take the corresponding AP test.

    The teacher who will be supervising Self-Guided Study at Tahoma is Liz DeOrnellas. Students who are interested can contact Ms. DeOrnellas at edeornellas@summitps.org or reach out to the Expeditions Dean, Monica Hanson, at mhanson@summitps.org.
