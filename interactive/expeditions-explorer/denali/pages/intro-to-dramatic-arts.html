    The Introduction to Dramatic Arts course at Tahoma is a place for students to take a breath. Students are encouraged to explore their emotions in a safe environment.

    Iona Robinson, a Tahoma freshman, described her experience with drama by saying, “You have to tap into emotions that you might not be feeling … It definitely helps you express yourself a lot more.”

    Estrella Esparza-Johnson, known to students as Ms. E, is the teaching artist contracted to teach both the Introduction to Dramatic Arts class as well as the Modern Acting and Theatre course at Tahoma. Her company, Estronemicas DMR, has taught at Tahoma for four years.

    “Drama is all about the pursuit and expression of truth, of humanity, of our experiences, our lives and what we believe that truth to be,” Ms. E explained. “That is my passion.”
