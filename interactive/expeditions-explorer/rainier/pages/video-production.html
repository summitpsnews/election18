    The Expeditions course Video Production is a class were you learn about filmmaking. In this class, students make short films every Expeditions round; students are able to pick their topic for most of the films they make, but the teacher assigns work groups.

    Rainier sophomore Hannah Kuo is in her first year learning about film; ever since her group made their first film, she fell in love with filming and learning new techniques. Kuo is thinking of continuing to develop her love for film and is considering taking the advanced version of Video Production next year. She really enjoys the way Mr. Nelson teaches the class.
