    Modern Acting and Theatre is a different experience compared to the introductory drama course. The advanced course teaches students the techniques and emotions of acting: it’s a college-level course meant to prepare students for the acting world. Ran by the production company Estronemicas, the drama course is a chance for aspiring actors to show the experience they have.

    Ron Johnson, a professional actor and teacher of the advanced drama course said, “I wanted to do a theatre class with a twist, because Expeditions is supposed to be about giving students experiences that they’d get should they chose to move into a profession, but without having to actually, definitely make the choice.”

    Tahoma senior Sydney Martinez, who has been with the course for four years, said, “We learned how to make our own acting resume and be able to find ways to make a career out of the things we learned in the class. Over time that stuff grows and becomes more complex.”
