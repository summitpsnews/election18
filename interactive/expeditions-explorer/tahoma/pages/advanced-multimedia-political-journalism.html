    Between traveling to Redwood City to visit Summit Everest and Prep and visiting the <a href="http://www.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily/">Spartan Daily</a> (San Jose State’s school newspaper), the journalism program at Summit Tahoma has had a profound influence on the students and teachers at the school. This year in Advanced Multimedia Political Journalism the students have written about an array of topics and have developed as self-guided reporters.

    Colleen Bateman, a senior at Summit Tahoma, served as the Tahoma Editor-in-Chief of <a href="http://www.summitpsnews.org">Summit News</a>. She and her fellow AMPJ peers answered a few questions regarding their experiences from this Expeditions class. Bateman talked about the highlight of the past year: “My highlight has been <a href="https://www.summitpsnewsmagazine.com/interactive/schools/">the story that my team and I did on how well Summit prepares you for college</a>. And the reason that was the highlight was because we came up with the idea within a 20-minute meeting pitch and then we just ran with it.” Bateman has written about:<a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2016/12/04/students-advocate-for-acting-classes/">Students advocating for acting class</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2016/12/04/a-drama-teacher-defends-her-craft/">A drama teacher defends her craft</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2016/12/04/losing-the-arts-means-losing-education/">The impact of losing the arts</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2017/03/30/public-schools-accept-religion-as-part-of-their-community/">Public schools and their relationship with religion</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2017/04/03/cunanan-describes-volleyball-experience/">The school volleyball team</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2017/04/11/art-at-celebration-of-learning-showcases-students-knowledge/">The arts at the Celebration of Learning</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2018/01/28/sociology-of-law-equips-students-with-the-skills-to-tackle-politics/">Sociology of Law</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2018/06/04/young-photographer-describes-her-passion-and-plans-for-the-future/">Photography</a>, <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2018/09/26/rep-lofgren-visits-local-school-to-talk-about-policies/">Zoe Lofgren visiting Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.summitpsnewsmagazine.com/interactive/schools/">How Summit prepares students for college</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://summitpsnews.org/2019/01/09/downtown-anticipates-major-changes-from-proposed-google-campus/">Google’s downtown campus proposal</a>.

I think my students have become much more efficient at interviewing and writing and video editing on deadlines, which is great.”
