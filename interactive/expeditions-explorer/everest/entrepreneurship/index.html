    Entrepreneurship is an Expeditions course that teaches students how to start a business, negotiate and overall become successful with their own startups. The class consists of creating products and advertising these products to people who would be interested in buying them.

    Danica Lyming, the Entrepreneurship Expeditions teacher, said, “[Students] basically learn how to make your own product or service. You make it; you advertise it; you pitch it at a competition and potentially win money.”

    Shasta freshman Javier Gomez talked about the creative freedom Ms. Lyming gives them as they create their products. He said, “You can make anything; she lets you run wild with that idea.”
