   In Adulting 101, students learn things like how to make a bank account, how to use a credit card and how to live a healthy life. The students basically learn what it is like to be an adult, and the class helps them prepare for their future.

    The Celebration of Learning project they made were posters on the most important thing that they learned. They also made PSA (Public Service Announcement) videos about topics such as taxes.

    Everest freshman Jennifer Mota, a student from Adulting 101, explained: “Some things we learn in this class are how to open a checking account, how to manage my credit, my debit, and how to rent a house.”
