    The Video Production course at Summit Shasta allows students to get a better understanding of how to construct a video.
</p>
<p>
    By going over certain tasks to enhance their knowledge of film, students get the opportunity to complete projects such as music videos, documentaries, mockumentaries and fight scenes.
</p>
<p>
    The Video Production course also gives students the ability to express their own ideas in their films. Shasta freshman Samuel Zhang said, “I feel like Video Production is a safe place to express people’s creativity through making videos and movies about different topics.”
</p>
<p>
    Following this idea, Zhang concluded that the environment he works in promotes creativity, allowing every film in Video Production to be unique. He also said the class culture helps people work together respectfully.

    Vincent Nelson, the teacher for the Video Production course at Summit Shasta, specifically teaches students in this course how to use cameras, how to edit videos and how to use necessary equipment such as microphones.

<p>
    Mr. Nelson believes that in this course students get the experience of working as a team to produce a quality outcome. He said, “I think Video Production is important for a few reasons: it teaches you how to work with a team, which you’ll need no matter what the job is.”

    Mr. Nelson concluded that teamwork is very important because it promotes good friendships and helps bring creativity to people in the workplace.
