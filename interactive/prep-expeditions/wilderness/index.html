    Introducing Wilderness to Summit Public Schools as a full-day Expeditions class taught by Melissa Bernstein has helped students experience and adventure through the outdoors and discover what students have been missing.

    This class started in the 2016-17 school year, but it began as a half-day class. That changed when Ms. Bernstein decided to provide a wider experience â€“ instead of learning from indoor classroom activities and short daily trips, the students now go on backpacking trips that can take days outside of school. This class is a great opportunity to better understand the outdoors.
