When you walk into room 11, you see students listening to music and finding songs that relate to their personal stories.

“We all participated in doing a music diary and the teacher ask the students how we’re feeling so the type of music that we listen to is the same feeling that we’re feeling,” Summit Prep sophomore Daneyah Penisini said.

The Exploring Music Expeditions course builds community by engaging students in activities where they study music and relate to songs. The projects they do range from making their own album art to writing their own songs at the end of the course.

This song changed me because it told me how people can fall into alcohol abuse from just one moment of peer pressure and how it affected them. I never want to be like that.”

Penisini expressed her opinion that music has a positive effect on the community “because it gives us something in common to meet other people.”

Summit Prep freshman Josh Gutierrez Ramirez explained that in class, “We do musical diaries and other music related analysis types of projects where we talk about how [music] affects us and what the lyrics mean.”

Gutierrez said, for their last project, “We made a playlist of songs that reflect big events in our life.”

Additionally, Penisini said, “For our last project, I believe we were making a playlist of song that impacted our life and explaining how they were an impact on our life.”

When asked why she joined the class Penisini said, “To be honest I only signed up … because my friends were going to but once I started the class I realized that is a good class and it allows us to listen to music that we love”

This song has helped me help others who were going through tough times, it allowed me to be placed in their shoes and how to approach them.”

To describe his impression on the class Gutierrez said, “It’s a good class but sometimes there are behavior issues with getting on track.”

Adding on, Penisini said, “This class is fairly simple and it’s about students that like to listen to music and understand it in a deeply level.”

In conclusion, relating to music in the community helps students in both their home and school life.
