        This website is entirely student made by one to two webmasters at each school. We have varying programming experience, and have come together to create this website for the Journalism class. We started at Shasta, and the website has been passed on from
        school to school, getting added onto by each webmaster to become the website you see today. Thanks from the Shasta webmasters!
